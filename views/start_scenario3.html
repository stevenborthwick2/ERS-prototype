	 <h2 class="heading-medium">Before you start</h2>
	 <p>You’ll need to know if any options were granted, exercised, released or exchanged under this scheme during the tax year. If relevant, you’ll also need to provide group scheme information and report any alterations or variations to share capital that have been made in relation to the scheme.</p>

<p>If options have been granted, exercised, released or exchanged, you’ll need to upload your spreadsheet as an OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ODS file).</p>
